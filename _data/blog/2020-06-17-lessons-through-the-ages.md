Wisdom has grown from many biblical passages I heard when I was young. I spent many vacations in parts of the “bible belt.” I did not realize at the time that this would be a large part of my foundational leadership principles.

A terrific place to begin is with Daniel 11:33:

“Those who are wise will instruct many.”

One focus of leadership is to share wisdom. How an individual translates and applies the information is what makes it unique and personal.

Wisdom is attractive. It bridges what may be lacking in experience and understanding.

Another important step for leaders is reflection.

Take time to reflect and recognize the lessons before you.

Determine how they apply to life moving forward. If you are blessed with such wisdom it is a benefit to share.

If you are training followers your reach is good; however if you are training leaders your impact is great. Leaders can take wisdom and share it with others. This can be done through examples and stories as well as first-hand testimonials. The ability to grow and prosper other people is priceless. In this leadership position it is truly the giving that is the receiving.

This foundational idea also puts us in the position to be advocates for one another instead of adversaries. How many times have you viewed other people and viewed them as a threat?

If we look at Proverbs 14:30:

“A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.”

The minute you start comparing yourself to others you begin the “rot” and build up a spirit of discontent. A true leader will rise above this temptation and share. This is not a new concept however it is not one that gets much publicity. The next time you start “keeping score” think about these passages. Turn the situation around and see if it makes a difference in your sense of peace and well-being.

Share your knowledge and listen. We all have room to prosper and grow. As I think of the lessons my grandparents showed me through actions and deed I am so grateful. If you yearn to share a smile with someone who has impacted your life in a similar way, consider Grand Box and get ready to SMILE. www.mygrandbox.com.
