The word “retirement” is enough to fill many people with excitement — as it signals the end of having to go to work every day and get up early every morning just to pay the bills. While some people have lots of great ideas about what they’re going to do once they’ve retired, there are plenty of others who aren’t so sure. With this in mind, we have put together a great list of retirement adventures that you might want to try, so this should give you plenty to look forward to.

Travel

This is something that you might never have had the chance to do before due to work commitments, but the world really is your oyster now. Take a look at some travel magazines, and see the kinds of places you might like to visit. Or, if you’re feeling really daring, close your eyes and stick a pin in a map of the world, and then book a trip to wherever it lands.

Start a new business

This might seem like an odd suggestion considering you’re in retirement, but many people have business ideas for years, without having the time to actually get them going Now, you definitely have the time, and a small business could keep you active and busy, giving you something great to focus on.

Volunteer

There are lots of places that you can volunteer, including charities, schools and animal shelters — so you can find somewhere that fits in with your interests. You will be able to choose something that you really love, meet new people, and choose hours that suit you — so you absolutely have full control over your own retirement, and can boost your sense of purpose at the same time.

Continue your education

Did you always feel that you missed out by not getting a degree? There’s no age limit on learning, so now is the ideal time to go back to your studies. Lots of colleges have adult learning courses, and many are simply mixed age, meaning that you can choose something that you’re really interested in, and just give it a go.

Get creative!

Creativity is something that really can keep the brain working, however we don’t always have the time to follow creative pursuits while working. Now is the perfect time to start, so have a go at writing that book you’ve always been thinking about, or buy a cheap musical instrument and get some lessons. You might even find that you have a talent for something that you had never even imagined!

One thing that is for sure is that retirement is not the end, like lots of people might think. It is, in fact, the beginning of a very exciting new stage in your life, where you have the chance to do everything that you wanted to during your working life. These ideas are just a start, but once you’ve got the taste for adventure, you should find that your retirement is exciting, and leaves you looking forward to what each new day will bring.
