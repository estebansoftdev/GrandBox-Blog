Chicago, IL. Since its inception in the spring of 2013, GrandBox has connected tens of thousands of families from all 50 states, with their subscription boxes curated specifically for seniors and grandparents.



“We created GrandBox as a unique way to connect with your senior parents, grandparents, family, and friends,” says co-founder Joe Yeoman. “Over the years many people move away, don’t visit family as much as they’d like, have a family member move into retirement home, or simply run out of gift ideas. We’ve worked hard over these past five years to make each GrandBox the perfect gift for those senior loved ones. Whether it’s a nostalgic treat, a fun theme, or a personal touch, it’s important that each care package reflects the love and appreciation you have for those who are receiving it.”



Designed specifically for the 42 Million Americans over the age of 65, the GrandBox subscription box for seniors and grandparents helps connect families. For as low as $30.00 a month, anyone can send a senior loved one a curated package that combines quality gifts, healthy treats, and personal photos and a note. Each GrandBox is affordable, unique, and a fun gift care package that never fails to put a smile on the face (and sometimes a tear in the eye) of the recipient.



“Since we started five years ago, the response has been overwhelming. People reach out to us daily, expressing how much their loved ones look forward to their GrandBoxes. They tell us how much of an impact GrandBox’s monthly care packages have had on their lives and personal relationships. It’s been extremely gratifying, to say the least. We look forward to helping more families connect and hearing more wonderful stories in the years ahead.”
